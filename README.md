# Chicago Traffic Crashes


The Chicago Traffic Crashes dataset, an open source dataset provided by the City of Chicago, has real data representing traffic crashes since September 2017 (with a few districts being represented since 2015). The dataset was downloaded from the Chicago Data Portal on November 8, 2020.

The goal of the project is gather information from the dataset and to implement machine learning models in order to advise a hypothetical Vehicle Advisory Board to prevent future accidents. This project focused on the use of Decision Tree Classifiers and Ensemble Methods with the use of GridSearch CV for hypertuning parameters. The target variable for this research is fatal crashes. The outcome of this research is a very accurate model with features selection that suggest which conditions of traffic crashes, in particular fatal crashes, that the Vehicle Advisory Board can work on improving.
